Introduction
------------
TESCA is a calculation tool primarily designed to compare access to opportunity
measures within juristictions in the United States, and to compare the
distributive equity of these access scores across multiple demographic groups.

Specifically, TESCA allows for comparison of these values based on variances in
travel time matrices generated by two sets of transit schedules, times of day,
days of the week, or modes of travel. For example, a comparison could be made
between weekday morning and weekend morning access to opportunities by
specifying these two travel times in the configuration, or between to different
networks (an existing and proposed) at the same travel times.
